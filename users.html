                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    coreboot is a replacement for your BIOS / UEFI with a strong focus on boot speed, security and flexibility. It is designed to boot your operating system in less than one second without any compromise to security, with no back doors, and without any cruft
                    from the 80s.
                    <br/> It was originally designed for large super computers with thousands of nodes, but it will run on your desktop, headless internet server, laptop, tablet or your favorite IOT device.
                </p>

                <h1>Why coreboot?</h1>

                <h2>Using Open Source Software</h2>
                <p>
                    coreboot is built on the principles of Open Source Software. Many of the engineers working on coreboot have also worked on the Linux kernel. Instead of keeping improvements to one system a secret from all other vendors, in coreboot, these improvements
                    are shared across the board, providing end users with a much better, much more stable firmware.

                    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        With coreboot, you can add your boot splash screen in jpg format instead of messing around with BMP derivatives from the 70s. Or you can boot so fast that there's not even time to show a splash screen. You can get a serial console showing your boot log.
                        Or you can show the boot log once your operating system is up and running.
                    </p>

                        And you can enjoy all the other cool features of coreboot that we didn't describe here yet.

                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        coreboot supports a secure boot process. Unlike UEFI's secure boot, coreboot does not attempt to lock the end user out of their machine, but instead provides rock solid protection from internet viruses, government trojans, and other scary stuff. coreboot's
                        security has been audited by the world's top security analysts and is not based on security by obscurity (insert link to bios password stored in ACPI table) and no big show and air bubbles.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Safety</h2>
                    <p>
                        coreboot engineers have worked on many safety critical software projects. The architecture of coreboot is designed to have an unbrickable update process. Updating firmware should be no more dangerous than installing your favorite app on your mobile phone.

                    <h1>How to get coreboot?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to get coreboot is to purchase a system with coreboot pre-installed. You can get coreboot pre-installed on many systems out there:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The biggest deployment are Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chrome OS devices</a>.
