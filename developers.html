                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    coreboot (formerly known as LinuxBIOS) believes in the principles of Open Source software. It borrows many well known concepts from other Open Source projects, like Kconfig, the Linux kernel coding style, a git repository, gerrit for code reviews.
                    <br/> The coreboot community now has more than 150 contributors a year, and is backed by many corporations, such as Google, Intel, AMD, ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional firmware development works with one-off shots for a given device. That is why you can still buy so many devices with buggy firmware. The bug was fixed a long time ago, just not in your copy of the tree. This won't happen to you with coreboot.
                </p>

                <h1>Architecture</h1>
                <p>
                    coreboot has a multi stage architecture, which is described in this picture:
                </p>
                <img src="img/architecture.jpg" alt="architecture" />

                <h2>Interfaces</h2>
                <p>
                    The interfaces to the operating system are
                    <ul>
                        <li>coreboot table</li>
                        <li>cbmem</li>
                        <li>payload interface</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    coreboot is super flexible for your use case. You can use compatibility payloads like TianoCore, SeaBIOS or Grub2, use depthcharge if you are focussed on security, or write your very own.
                </p>
                </h2>

                <h2>Flash Layout</h2>
                <p>
                    coreboot uses two conceptsw for storing information in flash: FMAP, which is roughly equivalent to a partition table, and CBFS, which is coreboot's flash filesystem.
                </p>

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>
                    coreboot has excellent debugging and testing capabilities built in:
                </p>

                <h3>Logs</h3> Logs can be produced on many different media: Serial console, USB debug, EM100 SPI, in memory, etc.

                <p>
                    The times when boot time did not matter on a device are over. They got stuck in EFI and main frame land. coreboot provides detailed timing information on where your boot time is spent.

                <h2>Getting the code</h2>
                <p>
                    The latest code is always available at <a href="https://review.coreboot.org/">our Git repo</a> or, if you are working for a company that is using coreboot for their products, you should base your work on the latest <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Releases">release version of coreboot</a>.
                    You can file <a href="https://tickets.coreboot.org">bugs or feature requests</a>. You can trivially get the code by doing:
                </p>
                <pre>
$ git clone https:/...
</pre>
                <p>
                    Since firmware is making a lot of assumptions on how your toolchain is working, you need to install the coreboot reference toolchain by doing
                </p>
                <pre>
$ cd util/crossgcc
$ make all
</pre>

                <h2>Submitting Patches</h2> Patches can be submitted through <a href="http://review.coreboot.org/">Gerrit</a>.

                <h2>Releases</h2>
                <p>
                    coreboot has a 3 month release cycle. With every release there will be a ChangeLog and a howto that expains how to bring your mainboard or chipset forward from the previous version.
                </p>

                <h2>Working with Hardware</h2>
                <p>We carefully selected a list of hardware tools that will make dealing with coreboot a lot easier. Part of the process of choosing this hardware is that it either works with open source utilities, or we write Open Source utilities for it.
                    These utilities make it easy to build and deploy coreboot in automated environments.</p>

                <p>
                    coreboot supports a verified boot process which will let you roll out signed firmware updates. In order to produce a signed firmware, you have to do X

                <h3>Using Your Own Key</h3>
                <p>Here is how you set up your own set of keys</p>
                <p>
                    In particular, private keys should <b>only</b> be kept on Hardware Security Mechanisms, and used on machines (or virtual machine) that have limited network access, or networking completely disabled. The machine and any backups also
                    need to be kept physically secure.
