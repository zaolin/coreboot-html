                <h1>Getting started</h1>
                <p>Coreboot provides a fast, reliable, secure, and predictable boot firmware solution for numerous modern and legacy chipsets. Users are running millions of coreboot based devices like Google Chromebooks and Chromeboxes, and it runs in many
                    datacenters. In 2016, coreboot.org has over 300 active developers and 60000 lines of code added each quarter.</p>

                <h1>Advantages</h1>
                <p>Using coreboot has numerous advantages and sure there are disadvantages..

                    <h3>Extreme fast</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is designed to do the minimum amount necessary, and get out of the way.</li>
                        <li>Especially for servers coreboot provides faster boot up.</li>
                        <li>Desktop and Notebooks boot up in 400ms - 2.5s.</li>
                        <li>Server boot up with 256gb of RAM in 5 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Flexible and customizable</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because coreboot does hardware init, then jumps to a payload to continue, it is very flexible.</li>
                        <li>Payload support for everything which is a ELF binary. Feel free to ship your own payload !</li>
                        <li>The core of coreboot is GPLv2 licensed. Payloads can be proprietary and we offer a BSD licensed support library.</li>
                        <li>Coreboot provides different <i>ready to build in</i> payloads like UEFI, SeaBIOS, U-Boot, Grub2 and many more..</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Made with safety in mind</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recovery Mode based on multiple copies of the firmware which can be updated independently.</li>
                        <li>Integrity of stages and binaries in coreboot can be easily verified.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Designed for security by default</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses a minimal trusted computing base for each platform which is easily auditable, helping to guarantee security.</li>
                        <li>As coreboot is Open Source, anyone can check the codebase.</li>
                        <li>The simpler structure of coreboot cuts down on the number of paths through the code, and the number of bugs.</li>
                        <li>After it has completed initialization, more than 99% of the code is removed from memory.</li>
                        <li>Platform security features are supported like IOMMU, flash protections, TEE and more..</li>
                        <li>Coreboot comes with Secure Boot support called VBOOT2.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Debugging done easily</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are multiple ways to extract the boot log, from classic serial, to EHCI debug, even over the pc-speaker.</li>
                        <li>Using the partner-project Serialice, software debug is available from just after the reset vector.</li>
                        <li>GDB Stub support via serial.</li>
                        <li>In memory console log support</li>
                        <li>Tracing functions and other exotic features as well supported.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Saves costs and time</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlike UEFI EDK2, it includes full platform support for different architectures and SoC vendors.</li>
                        <li>Unlike U-Boot, coreboot strongly encourages a single source tree model,
                            <br>making it easier to adapt feature development to different boards and chipsets.</li>
                        <li>X86, ARM/64, MIPS, POWER8 and RISC-V are supported architectures.</li>
                        <li>It works with operating systems like Windows, OS X, Linux and Android out of the box.</li>
                        <li>Supported and maintained code for Intel FSP and AMD AGESA platforms.</li>
                        <li>Porting new hardware on an existing chipset to coreboot can done extremely quickly within less than 1 week.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Quality assurance</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All changes to the code are peer reviewed, so that the high quality requirements are fulfilled. Additionally, changes are build and run tested.</li>
                        <li>There are test frameworks like REACTS or LAVA to hook up your device and perform automated testing.</li>
                    </ul>
